## **What Are Coroutines?**

Coroutines provide a mechanism for **non-preemptive multitasking**. Unlike threads, which use **preemptive multitasking** (where the operating system suspends threads to let others run), coroutines allow functions to **yield control** voluntarily and resume later from the same point.

### **Key Features of Coroutines**

- **Suspend-able Functions**: Functions can pause (suspend) and resume execution.
- **Coroutine Context**: Provides context for suspend functions, including information like the dispatcher, job, and more.

## **Structured Concurrency**

- **GlobalScope**: Avoid using `GlobalScope` as it breaks structured concurrency.
- **CoroutineScope**: Use scoped coroutines to ensure proper lifecycle management.

## **Suspend Functions**

### **What is a Suspend Function?**

- **Definition**: A function marked with the `suspend` keyword that can pause its execution without blocking the thread.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Asynchronous and potentially long-running.
    - Can only be called from other suspend functions or within a coroutine.
    - Introduces **suspension points** where execution can pause and resume later.
- **Promise**: Suspend functions never block the calling thread.

### **Example of a Suspend Function**

```kotlin
suspend fun addBlog(title: String) {
    val id = authenticate()
    val blog = createBlogAsync(id, title)
    processBlog(blog)
}
```

---

## **How Suspend Functions Work**

### **Logical Callbacks**

Suspend functions are logically transformed into **callback-based code** by the compiler. For example, the above `addBlog` function is conceptually transformed into:

```kotlin
fun addBlog(title: String) {
    authenticate { id ->               // Callback when authenticate completes
        createBlogAsync(id, title) { blog ->  // Callback when createBlogAsync completes
       processBlog(blog)          // Executes immediately since its not callback
        }
    }
}
```

### **Continuation-Passing Style (CPS)**

The Kotlin compiler transforms suspend functions into **Continuation-Passing Style (CPS)**:

- Adds a **Continuation Object** as an extra parameter.
- Converts the function into a **state machine** using labels to track execution points.

### **Transformed `addBlog` Function**

```kotlin
fun addBlog(title: String, cont: Continuation): Object {
    val sm = cont as? MyStateModel ?: object : MyStateModel {
        fun resume(...) {
            addBlog(null, this)  // Resume the coroutine
        }
    }
    when (sm.label) {
        0 -> {
            sm.title = title
            sm.label = 1
            authenticate(sm)  // Call authenticate with the state model
        }
        1 -> {
            val id = sm.result as Int
            sm.label = 2
            createBlogAsync(id, sm.title, sm)  // Call createBlogAsync
        }
        2 -> {
            val blog = sm.result as Blog
            processBlog(blog)  // Process the blog
        }
    }
}
```

### **Key Points in CPS Transformation**

1. **Continuation Object**: Tracks the state of the coroutine (e.g., `label`, intermediate results).
2. **State Machine**: Uses a `when` (or `switch`) statement to manage execution points.
3. **Resume Mechanism**: When an asynchronous operation completes, it calls the `resume` function, which recursively calls the function again to continue execution.

notice that the addBlog now takes a new parameter and which is a continuation object and the function now return an object.

inside the big switch statement it gets

now inside the switch case 0 the `authenticate(sm)` method is called with `sm` (stateModel) which has all the state that we need to carry on call the addBlog() 

and the label we set to 1 is the value of next label of the switch statement that will be used when we come back from authenticate call.

`MyStateModel` is a type of continuation which is a interface and `MyStateModel` would implement that interface

when for example authenticate is being called under the covers when authenticate has finished its worked and it wants to resume the coroutine it ends up calling resume function on the continuation that has passed to it by `sm` model and then resume function will end up calling addBlog again but with new label.

## **Why Can’t Suspend Functions Be Called Directly?**

Suspend functions require a **Continuation Object** to manage their state. This object is automatically provided by the compiler when called from another suspend function or a coroutine builder. Regular functions cannot provide this object, so suspend functions cannot be called directly from them.

---

## **Coroutine Builders**

Coroutine builders create coroutines and provide the initial **Continuation Object** needed to call suspend functions.

### **Types of Coroutine Builders**

1. **`runBlocking`**:
    - **Behavior**: Blocks the current thread while running the coroutine.
    - **Uses**:
        - Entry point in the `main` function.
        - Testing suspend functions.
        - Rare cases where a custom thread needs to call a suspend function.
    - **Caution**: Avoid excessive use as it blocks threads.
2. **`launch`**:
    - **Behavior**: Launches a coroutine asynchronously (non-blocking).
    - **Characteristics**:
        - Does not return a value (fire-and-forget).
    - **Common Use**: Most frequently used coroutine builder.
3. **Other Builders** (to be discussed later):
    - `async`
    - `coroutineScope`
